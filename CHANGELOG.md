## v1.0.1

This is a small bugfix, restoring compatibilty with older PHP versions (8.1, 8.2, 8.3).

### Fixed 🔷
* Fixed compatibilty with PHP v8.1, 8.2 and 8.3

## v1.0.0 "Prism" 🔷🌈

This release brings major improvements across the library.
In contrast to previous releases, it includes some breaking API changes. These were necessary to introduce more exciting features (including full support for the `Vector` data type 🤖) and to enhance and fix existing ones.

Upcoming 1.x releases will focus on stability and performance while keeping the API stable.

### Added 🔷
* Updated Asynchronous API, now providing additional helper methods (`waitForStatements`, `waitForAnyStatement`, `waitForAllPendingStatements`) and supporting non-blocking response processing (`drainAvailableResponses`, `tryResolveStatement`, `tryResolveStatements`, `tryReadNextResponse`)
* Events subsystem: blocking (`waitForNextEvent`) and non-blocking event polling (`tryReadNextEvent`)
* New `Value` capabilities including `Vector` data type support
* Support for configuring value encoding for data types with multiple encodings
* Warnings listener interface and registration
* Round-robin and random node selection strategies

### Changed 🔷
* Prepared statements: auto-prepare for typed execution, names-for-values auto-detection, re-prepare on UNPREPARED, metadata caching; helpers `executeAll`, pagination helpers
* Enforce a minimum `pageSize` of 100 in `QueryOptions` for efficient paging

### Fixed 🔷
* Numerous stability and correctness fixes across execute/query flows and pagination edge cases
* Richer server exception context (consistency levels, required/received counts, write types)

### Documentation 🔷
* Comprehensive README: quick start, configuration reference, async/event APIs, migration guide, error handling.

### Tests 🔷
* Added unit and integration tests for the critical parts of the library

## v0.8.1
* Allow types Date, Time, and Timestamp to be created from string values

## v0.8.0
* Improve API for prepared statements
* Fix a bug in `execute()` call
* Fix PHPDoc for `paging_state`
* Fix version calculation for server packets
* Replace `SplFixedArray` with `array`

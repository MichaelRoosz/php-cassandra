This release brings major improvements across the library.
In contrast to previous releases, it includes some breaking API changes. These were necessary to introduce more exciting features (including full support for the `Vector` data type ðŸ¤–) and to enhance and fix existing ones.

* Updated Asynchronous API, now providing additional helper methods (`waitForStatements`, `waitForAnyStatement`, `waitForAllPendingStatements`) and supporting non-blocking response processing (`drainAvailableResponses`, `tryResolveStatement`, `tryResolveStatements`, `tryReadNextResponse`)
* Events subsystem: blocking (`waitForNextEvent`) and non-blocking event polling (`tryReadNextEvent`)
* New `Value` capabilities including `Vector` data type support
* Support for configuring value encoding for data types with multiple encodings
* Warnings listener interface and registration
* Round-robin and random node selection strategies

### Changed ðŸ”·
* Prepared statements: auto-prepare for typed execution, names-for-values auto-detection, re-prepare on UNPREPARED, metadata caching; helpers `executeAll`, pagination helpers
* Enforce a minimum `pageSize` of 100 in `QueryOptions` for efficient paging

### Fixed ðŸ”·
* Numerous stability and correctness fixes across execute/query flows and pagination edge cases
* Richer server exception context (consistency levels, required/received counts, write types)

### Documentation ðŸ”·
* Comprehensive README: quick start, configuration reference, async/event APIs, migration guide, error handling.

### Tests ðŸ”·
* Added unit and integration tests for the critical parts of the library
